that are in the beginning of each new line by suggesting the user 
to manually replace all names to the needed ones.

ATTENTION: 
1) This script won't work if the symbol after a character name on a new line isn't a colon (':'). 
2) Only works for character names in the beginning of the sentence.
3) In order for it to work with other symbols right after character names, change all occurences of ':' up to your choice in the script.
